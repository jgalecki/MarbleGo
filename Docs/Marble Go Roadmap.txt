xx First weekend: Territory mechanics, basic ui
  Win / lose screen and game end conditions
  Marble shooting + physics
    UI for shooting
  Special marble types
    UI for selecting
  Better UI for territory creation
    Slower steps, make pausable
  P2P network multiplayer
    Direct connection via IP? No need for "server room" then
    

Open questions:
  Is triangle formation predictable enough?
  Once triangles are formed, they can be reformed or replaced when adding new pieces.
    Is this good
    Is this legible?
    Alternative: Keep old triangles, add new points on as new triangles
      Raycast to new places
      Or if inside a current triangle, add to all points
  Is territory formation legible enough?
    What UI can be added to help here?  
  
Ideas:
idea - pick places at the same time?
idea - triangles health + cancellation
idea - stuff on the board - weighted scores
idea - win condition as total percentage? Sudden death, even, black can have last turn
idea - battle royale - board shrinks - pulse?
idea - triangles solidify after X turns
idea - danger areas in the triangles

idea - shuffleboard, hive, crokinole, 
idea - capture mechanics?
idea - problem could be solved when marble mechanics are in place
idea - marbles have hit points, die when hit twice or three times


problem: last turn is too powerful
problem: eye-poking too powerful
