xx First weekend: Territory mechanics, basic ui
  xx Win / lose screen and game end conditions
  xx Marble shooting + physics
    xx UI for shooting
  __ Special marble types
    __ UI for selecting
  __ Better UI for territory creation
    __ Slower steps, make pausable
  P2P network multiplayer
    Direct connection via IP? No need for "server room" then
    

Open questions:
  Is triangle formation predictable enough?
  Once triangles are formed, they can be reformed or replaced when adding new pieces.
    Is this good
    Is this legible?
    Alternative: Keep old triangles, add new points on as new triangles
      Raycast to new places
      Or if inside a current triangle, add to all points
  Is territory formation legible enough?
    What UI can be added to help here?  
  
Ideas:
idea - pick places at the same time?
idea - triangles health + cancellation
idea - stuff on the board - weighted scores
idea - win condition as total percentage? Sudden death, even, black can have last turn
idea - battle royale - board shrinks - pulse?
idea - triangles solidify after X turns
idea - danger areas in the triangles

idea - shuffleboard, hive, crokinole, 
idea - capture mechanics?
idea - problem could be solved when marble mechanics are in place
idea - marbles have hit points, die when hit twice or three times


problem: last turn is too powerful
problem: eye-poking too powerful

Week 3
  xx Passing ends the game
  xx Stable and Unstable marbles
    xx Stable marbles can't be moved
